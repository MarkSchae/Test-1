# Testing

- There isn't a direct terminal command in Git itself to create a GitHub repository. However, you can use GitHub's API or command-line tools to automate the process of creating a repository on GitHub. One popular tool for this is the GitHub CLI (gh).

Using the GitHub CLI (gh):
Install GitHub CLI: If you haven't installed the GitHub CLI, you can download it from GitHub CLI.

Authenticate: Once installed, 

bash
Copy
Edit
gh auth login
Follow the prompts to log in to your GitHub account.

Create a GitHub Repository: After authentication, you can create a new repository on

bash
Copy
Edit
gh repo create <repo-name> --public --source=. --push
<repo-name>: Name of the repository.
--public or --private: Spec
For example:

bash
Copy
Edit
gh repo create my-project --public --source=. --push
This command will:

Create the repository on GitHub.
Push your local changes to the newly created repository. Adding
Summary:
While Git itself doesn't have a command for creating GitHub repositories, you can use the GitHub CLI to create and push a repository directly from the terminal.
